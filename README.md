# iicbasic

Stuff I wrote in AppleSoft BASIC on an Apple IIc in the mid/late 1990s. Useless but nostalgic

They were extracted from original 5.25" disks using my actual Apple IIc, [ADTPro](https://adtpro.com) running on macOS, and a serial cable/USB Adapter from [RetroFloppy](https://retrofloppy.com/products/).

These can be run with https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/
